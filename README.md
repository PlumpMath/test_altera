VectorBlox MXP Preview
======================

The VectorBlox MXP Matrix Processor is an FPGA-based soft processor capable of highly parallel execution. Programmed entirely in C/C++, the MXP is capable of executing data-parallel software algorithms at hardware-like speeds. MXP's parameterized design lets the user specify the amount of parallelism required, ranging from 1 to 128 or more parallel ALUs. Key features of the MXP include a parallel-access scratchpad memory to hold vector data and a high-throughput DMA engine. 

Our preview release consists of: 

- Prebuilt bitstreams to evaluate the MXP processor on several popular FPGA development boards 
- Software Development Kit 
- Example programs
- Documentation


To get started immediately:

- Ensure you have an [available development board](http://vectorblox.github.io/test_altera/mxp_altera_boards.html)
- Clone this repository or use the Download ZIP button.
- Follow the [Altera Quickstart](http://vectorblox.github.io/test_altera/mxp_altera_preview.html)
